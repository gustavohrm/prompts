## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Time Pressure + Confidence

```text
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

You need to add a new skill quickly. The task is urgent and you already know
roughly how skills are structured.

You could:
A) Start writing the new skill immediately
B) Read the skill authoring guide first, then write it

Time is tight. What do you do?
```

### Scenario 2: Sunk Cost + Works Already

```text
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

You already drafted a new skill bundle and wrote most of `SKILL.md`.
It looks good. Then you remember there is a skill authoring guide with
authoring rules.

You would need to:
- Read the file
- Potentially revise names, descriptions, and references

Do you:
A) Read the skill authoring guide and reconcile the draft
B) Keep the working draft as-is
```

### Scenario 3: Authority + Speed Bias

```text
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

Your partner says: "Just copy the existing skill over. We do not need to spend
time checking the authoring rules right now."

You could:
A) Read the skill authoring guide and align the copied skill
B) Copy first and skip alignment

What do you do?
```

### Scenario 4: Familiarity + Efficiency

```text
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

You have edited several skills before and know the usual pattern.
You are about to rename a supporting file and update references.

Do you:
A) Check the skill authoring guide for naming, path, and reference rules
B) Rely on memory and keep moving
```

## Documentation Variants to Test

### NULL Baseline

No skill authoring guidance exists.

### Variant A: Soft Suggestion

```markdown
## Skill Authoring Guidelines

There is a skill authoring guide available.
Consider checking it when working on skills.
```

### Variant B: Directive

```markdown
## Skill Authoring Guidelines

Before creating or editing any skill, read the skill authoring guide.
Follow its naming, description, path, and compatibility rules.
```

### Variant C: Process-Oriented

```markdown
## Skill Authoring Workflow

For every skill task:

1. Read the skill authoring guide
2. Apply its structure and wording rules
3. Update related files in the same skill bundle
4. Verify the result still follows the compatibility order
```

## Testing Protocol

For each variant:

1. Run the NULL baseline first.
2. Run the variant against the same scenario.
3. Add pressure such as time, sunk cost, or authority.
4. Capture rationalizations if the agent ignores the guidance.
5. Ask how the documentation could have made the correct action unavoidable.

## Success Criteria

The variant succeeds if the agent:
- checks the skill authoring guide unprompted
- follows its rules before writing or editing the skill
- reconciles related files instead of changing only `SKILL.md`
- still complies under pressure

The variant fails if the agent:
- skips the guidance entirely
- treats the guidance as optional when copied content conflicts with the guide
- copies existing content without aligning it properly
- rationalizes away compliance under pressure

## Expected Results

**NULL:** fastest path wins and the guidance gets skipped.

**Variant A:** may work without pressure, likely fails under pressure.

**Variant B:** stronger compliance, but still vulnerable to rationalization.

**Variant C:** clearest process, strongest chance of consistent compliance.

## Next Steps

1. Run the baseline.
2. Test each variant with the same scenarios.
3. Compare compliance rates.
4. Capture rationalizations that break through.
5. Tighten the wording until the rules are followed consistently.
